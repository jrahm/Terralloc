This is still a work in progress, and I have not yet had time to bang around with tying to get it to compile on 12.04. A statically linked binary has been included (These things are getting big!)

This program reads terrain.png and height.png to generate the terrain. You may edit these to your hearts content and look at the difference in the generated terrain.

The water is still a work in progress. I am trying to get pseudo reflections to work and it is not being the best.

Controls:
    w,s,mouse - move
    =/- - speed up time/slow down time
