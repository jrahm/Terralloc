Terralloc
--------

Welcome to the wonderful worlds generated by Terralloc. This program is an
OpenGL program written in 100% Haskell which allows you to build worlds based
off of terrain maps and height maps. Look in the `maps` folder for some example
worlds.

Usage
-----

To use Terralloc just compile it with `cabal install` and run it with the
`./terralloc` script. Ex `./terralloc spain`

Requirements
------------

As far as Haskell goes, this project is NOT portable. You must compile it using
GHC since Terralloc makes liberal use of the many useful GHC extensions.

For an OS, this was developed and tested on Arch Linux and Ubuntu 12.04
theoretically it should run on Mac and maybe Windows, but I have to way of
testing it.

Running the built-in maps requires a beefy GPU with support for at least OpenGL
4.0

This project uses SDL on OpenGL, so make sure the libraries for both are
installed.

Academia
--------

For those of you who are as nerdy as I and am looking for a good example of
modern OpenGL in Haskell. This is a really good resource, if you are willing to
pick through it.

I plan soon to start a project Hagl (pronounced Haggle) separate from the
current HOpenGL for a fully integrated OpenGL complete with compile-time meta
programming to include, check and integrate shader source with the Haskell code
to maximize the benefits of the GHC type system and ensure correctness of code.
